Home Automation API

haapi is a Home Automation framework written in node.js for controlling all aspects of a modern automated home.  It controls infrared devices, TCP/IP-connected devices, ligthing, and is controlled through intuitave tablet or smartphone devices.

The initial proof of concept was developed for my own home, but I will be modularizing this code so that it will work in any home with a myriad of devices.

Stay tuned...
