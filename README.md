Home Automation API

HAAPI is a Home Automation framework written in node.js for controlling all aspects of a modern automated home.  It controls and can communicate with any number of devices, from infrared, TCP/IP-connected devices, lighting, temperature control, etc.  HAAPI is controlled through any manner of intuitave tablet or smartphone means.

The initial proof of concept was developed for my own home, but I will be modularizing this code so that it will work in any home with a myriad of devices.

Stay tuned...
